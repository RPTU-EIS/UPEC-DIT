# UPEC-DIT
This repository contains experiments and results on using UPEC to formally prove data-independent timing in hardware.

The method was first published at DAC'22: 

*L. Deutschmann, J. Müller, M. R. Fadiheh, D. Stoffel, and W. Kunz, “Towards a formally verified hardware root-of-trust for data-oblivious computing,” in Proceedings of the 59th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference, ser. DAC’22. New York, NY, USA: Association for Computing Machinery, 2022, p. 727–732.* Available: [https://doi.org/10.1145/3489517.3530981](https://doi.org/10.1145/3489517.3530981)

In a subsequent journal paper, we revised the approach to further improve its scalability and to elaborate on its completeness:

Kunz, "A Scalable Formal Verification Methodology for Data-Oblivious Hardware," in IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, vol. 43, no. 9, pp. 2551-2564, Sept. 2024.* Available: [https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2024.3374249](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2024.3374249)

All experiments were conducted using OneSpin 360 DV by Siemens EDA. 
Setup scripts can be found in each folder.

For an easy-to-understand example, we suggest you take a look at our [experiment on this SHA cryptographic accelerator](https://github.com/RPTU-EIS/UPEC-DIT/blob/master/examples/functional-units/SHA-Cores/sha512_dit.sva).
